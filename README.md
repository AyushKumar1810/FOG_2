# Getting Started with Create React App

This project has been bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which is a powerful tool developed by Facebook that simplifies the process of setting up a new React application. It provides a solid foundation and a set of configurations that allow developers to focus on writing code instead of managing build configurations.

## Available Scripts

Once you are in the project directory, you can run several scripts that are predefined to help you with various tasks related to the development and management of your application:

## High-Level Approach
The main goal of this project is to simulate a visually appealing falling rain effect by utilizing a grid made up of individual cells. Hereâ€™s a detailed yet concise approach to achieve this effect effectively:

**Grid Setup:**
- First, you will need to define the size of the grid by specifying the number of rows and columns. This will determine how the rain effect is displayed.
- Next, create the grid layout using CSS Grid Layout, which allows for a flexible and responsive design that can adapt to different screen sizes.

**Drops Initialization:**
- Initialize the drops by placing them at random positions within the grid. Each drop will have its own position as well as a fading trail effect that enhances the visual experience.

**Animation:**
- To create the animation, use `setInterval` to periodically update the position of each drop and its corresponding trail. This will create a dynamic effect that mimics the natural movement of falling rain.

**Color Change:**
- Implement another `setInterval` to periodically change the colors of the drops, introducing random hues that add variety and excitement to the visual display.

**Rendering:**
- Render the grid by styling the cells based on the current positions of the drops and their trails. Utilize CSS transitions to ensure that the animations are smooth and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Performance Measurement:**
- Optionally, you can measure the performance of your application by utilizing reportWebVitals. This will help you understand how well your app is performing and identify areas for potential improvement.

### `npm start`
This command will run the application in development mode. You can open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your application in action. The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code, and any linting errors will be displayed in the console for you to address.

### `npm test`
This command launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode, allowing you to run tests on your application. For more detailed information on how to run tests effectively, you can refer to the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
This command builds the application for production and places the output in the `build` folder. During the build process, React is optimized for performance, ensuring that your application runs smoothly in a production environment. The resulting build is minified, and the filenames are hashed to facilitate efficient caching. Once this process is complete, your application will be ready for deployment! For further information on the deployment process, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) documentation.

### `npm run eject`
**Important Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you choose to `eject`, you will not be able to go back!**

If you find that you are not satisfied with the default build tool and configuration provided by Create React App, you have the option to `eject` at any point. This action will remove the single build dependency from your project and expose all the configuration files, allowing for greater customization and control over the build process. However, please proceed with caution, as this decision is irreversible.
